1,IPv6,"Not a vulnerability, just an informational alert. The host does not have IPv6 support. IPv6 provides more security as IPSec (responsible for CIA - Confidentiality, Integrity and Availablity) is incorporated into this model. So it is good to have IPv6 Support.",It is recommended to implement IPv6. More information on how to implement IPv6 can be found from this resource. https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/enterprise/cisco-on-cisco/IPv6-Implementation_CS.html
2,ASP.Net Misconfiguration,Sensitive Information Leakage Detected. The ASP.Net application does not filter out illegal characters in the URL. The attacker injects a special character (%7C~.aspx) to make the application spit sensitive information about the server stack.,It is recommended to filter out special charaters in the URL and set a custom error page on such situations instead of showing default error messages. This resource helps you in setting up a custom error page on a Microsoft .Net Application. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-forms/overview/older-versions-getting-started/deploying-web-site-projects/displaying-a-custom-error-page-cs

This resource contains more information on how to secure your Joomla Blog. https://www.incapsula.com/blog/10-tips-to-improve-your-joomla-website-security.html
6,robots.txt/sitemap.xml,Sometimes robots.txt or sitemap.xml may contain rules such that certain links that are not supposed to be accessed/indexed by crawlers and search engines. Search engines may skip those links but attackers will be able to access it directly.,It is a good practice not to include sensitive links in the robots or sitemap files.
7,No Firewall,"Without a Web Application Firewall, An attacker may try to inject various attack patterns either manually or using automated scanners. An automated scanner may send hordes of attack vectors and patterns to validate an attack, there are also chances for the application to get DoS`ed (Denial of Service)","Web Application Firewalls offer great protection against common web attacks like XSS, SQLi, etc. They also provide an additional line of defense to your security infrastructure. This resource contains information on web application firewalls that could suit your application. https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/web-application-firewall"

This resource may give more insights. https://security.stackexchange.com/a/145781/6137
9,Email Found,"Chances are very less to compromise a target with email addresses. However, attackers use this as a supporting data to gather information around the target. An attacker may make use of the username on the email address and perform brute-force attacks on not just email servers, but also on other legitimate panels like SSH, CMS, etc with a password list as they have a legitimate name. This is however a shoot in the dark scenario, the attacker may or may not be successful depending on the level of interest",Since the chances of exploitation is feeble there is no need to take action. Perfect remediation would be choosing different usernames for different services will be more thoughtful.
10,Zone Transfer,Zone Transfer reveals critical topological information about the target. The attacker will be able to query all records and will have more or less complete knowledge about your host.,Good practice is to restrict the Zone Transfer by telling the Master which are the IPs of the slaves that can be given access for the query. This SANS resource  provides more information. https://www.sans.org/reading-room/whitepapers/dns/securing-dns-zone-transfer-868
11,Public Whois,"The email address of the administrator and other information (address, phone, etc) is available publicly. An attacker may use these information to leverage an attack. This may not be used to carry out a direct attack as this is not a vulnerability. However, an attacker makes use of these data to build information about the target.","Some administrators intentionally would have made this information public, in this case it can be ignored. If not, it is recommended to mask the information. This resource provides information on this fix. http://www.name.com/blog/how-tos/tutorial-2/2013/06/protect-your-personal-information-with-whois-privacy/"

30,multiple,Particular Scanner found multiple vulnerabilities that an attacker may try to exploit the target.,"Refer to RS-Vulnerability-Report to view the complete information of the vulnerability, once the scan gets completed."
31,Subdomains,Attackers may gather more information from subdomains relating to the parent domain. Attackers may even find other services from the subdomains and try to learn the architecture of the target. There are even chances for the attacker to find vulnerabilities as the attack surface gets larger with more subdomains discovered.,"It is sometimes wise to block sub domains like development, staging to the outside world, as it gives more information to the attacker about the tech stack. Complex naming practices also help in reducing the attack surface as attackers find hard to perform subdomain bruteforcing through dictionaries and wordlists."
32,Telnet,"Through this deprecated protocol, an attacker may be able to perform MiTM and other complicated attacks.","It is highly recommended to stop using this service and it is far outdated. SSH can be used to replace TELNET. For more information, check this resource https://www.ssh.com/ssh/telnet"
33,FTP,"This protocol does not support secure communication and there are likely high chances for the attacker to eavesdrop the communication. Also, many FTP programs have exploits available in the web such that an attacker can directly crash the application or either get a SHELL access to that target.",Proper suggested fix is use an SSH protocol instead of FTP. It supports secure communication and chances for MiTM attacks are quite rare.
34,STUXNET,The StuxNet is level-3 worm that exposes critical information of the target organization. It was a cyber weapon that was designed to thwart the nuclear intelligence of Iran.

Some critical resource regarding disbling WebDAV can be found on this URL. https://www.networkworld.com/article/2202909/network-security/-webdav-is-bad---says-security-researcher.html
36,Fingerprinting,"Attackers always do a fingerprint of any server before they launch an attack. Fingerprinting gives them information about the server type, content- they are serving, last modification times etc, this gives an attacker to learn more information about the target","A good practice is to obfuscate the information to outside world. Doing so, the attackers will have tough time understanding the server's tech stack and therefore leverage an attack."
37,Stress Tests,"Attackers mostly try to render web applications or service useless by flooding the target, such that blocking access to legitimate users. This may affect the business of a company or organization as well as the reputation","By ensuring proper load balancers in place, configuring rate limits and multiple connection restrictions, such attacks can be drastically mitigated."
38,"LFI, RFI or RCE",Intruders will be able to remotely include shell files and will be able to access the core file system or they will be able to read all the files as well. There are even higher chances for the attacker to remote execute code on the file system.,"Secure code practices will mostly prevent LFI, RFI and RCE attacks. The following resource gives a detailed insight on secure coding practices. https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/seccode/Top+10+Secure+Coding+Practices"
39,"XSS, SQLi, BSQLi ",Hackers will be able to steal data from the backend and also they can authenticate themselves to the website and can impersonate as any user since they have total control over the backend. They can even wipe out the entire database. Attackers can also steal cookie information of an authenticated user and they can even redirect the target to any malicious address or totally deface the application.,"Proper input validation has to be done prior to directly querying the database information. A developer should remember not to trust an end-user's input. By following a secure coding methodology attacks like SQLi, XSS and BSQLi. The following resource guides on how to implement secure coding methodology on application development. https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/seccode/Top+10+Secure+Coding+Practices"

They may also try to authenticate with default credentials to get themselves through.","Timely security patches for the backend has to be installed. Default credentials has to be changed. If possible, the banner information can be changed to mislead the attacker. The following resource gives more information on how to secure your backend. http://kb.bodhost.com/secure-database-server/"
48,RDP,Attackers may launch remote exploits to either crash the service or tools like ncrack to try brute-forcing the password on the target.,It is recommended to block the service to outside world and made the service accessible only through the a set of allowed IPs only really neccessary. The following resource provides insights on the risks and as well as the steps to block the service. https://www.perspectiverisk.com/remote-desktop-service-vulnerabilities/
49,SNMP,"Hackers will be able to read community strings through the service and enumerate quite a bit of information from the target. Also, there are multiple Remote Code Execution and Denial of Service vulnerabilities related to SNMP services.",Use a firewall to block the ports from the outside world. The following article gives wide insight on locking down SNMP service. https://www.techrepublic.com/article/lock-it-down-dont-allow-snmp-to-compromise-network-security/
50,Elmah,"Attackers will be able to find the logs and error information generated by the application. They will also be able to see the status codes that was generated on the application. By combining all these information, the attacker will be able to leverage an attack.",By restricting access to the logger application from the outside world will be more than enough to mitigate this weakness.
51,SMB Ports,Cyber Criminals mainly target this service as it is very easier for them to perform a remote attack by running exploits. WannaCry Ransomware is one such example.,"Exposing SMB Service to the outside world is a bad idea, it is recommended to install latest patches for the service in order not to get compromised.
